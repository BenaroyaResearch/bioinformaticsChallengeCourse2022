# 2022-2023 Bioinformatics Challenge Course

This is the repository for storing information and data from the Bioinformatics 2022-2023 Challenge Course.

The challenges provided are designed to help researchers familiarize themselves with R using guided instructions and provided data.  Beginning October, each challenge will contain input data, and pseudo-code instructions to help participants complete the challenge. The end result of each challenge will be a statistical analysis of the provided data and visualization of the results. Bioinformatician support will be available for questions during the length of the challenge course, though participants are encouraged to independently solve challenges to maximize their learning. Once monthly, the Bioinformatics Group will host a lunch sit-down meeting in order for participants to receive assistance in completing the challenge, and share their specific solutions/ideas regarding the analyses.

This challenge series is intended for those with some modest experience in R, particularly those who previously attended the R workshop in Summer 2022, though those new to the R environment are also encouraged to attempt any challenge.

The skills acquired by completing these challenges will be useful for researchers analyzing data commonly produced at Benaroya Research Institute (ie, Bulk RNA, single cell transcriptomics, and flow cytometry). By the end of the challenge series, participants will be comfortable performing basic analyses on their own data independently in R.

## Recommended software

The Bioinformatics group recommends Rstudio -- a user interface and developer environment for R. The desktop version of Tstudio can be acquired here:

## Wrapup Luncheon

On the fourth Tuesday of each month, the Bioinformatics Group will host a luncheon in order to answer any questions about the challenge as well as invite participants to share their solutions and insights into how they solved or were unable to solve the challenge. This luncheon is currently reserved for 2 N, and everyone is invited to attend regardless as to how far they progressed within the challenge.
